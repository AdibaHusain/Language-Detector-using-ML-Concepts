# Language-Detector-using-ML-Concepts
A simple yet powerful Language Detection project built using Machine Learning.
This is my first step into the world of AI and ML 🎉

The model can detect the language of a given text input.
It is trained on a dataset of 22 languages with ~1000 words per language.

🚀Features

Detects the language of any text input.
Trained using Bag of Words (BoW) model.
Uses train-test split for evaluation.
Implemented with popular ML libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
Python
NumPy – numerical computations
Pandas – dataset handling
Scikit-learn – machine learning models
Bag of Words (BoW) – feature extraction

📊 Dataset

22 different languages
~1000 words per language
Preprocessed and vectorized using BoW

⚙️ Installation & Usage

Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AdibaHusain/language-detector-using-ML-concepts.git


Input any text
Example:

"As I have dived into the world of AI and ML, this is my first step towards it."
Output → "English"

📈 Model Workflow

Load dataset
Preprocess text
Apply Bag of Words
Train ML model
Test & evaluate accuracy
Predict user input language

🎯 Future Improvements

Increase dataset size for better accuracy
Use TF-IDF instead of BoW
Implement deep learning (RNNs/LSTMs) for better text understanding
Build a simple Web App with Flask/Streamlit
